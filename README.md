# CNN playground
This is a playground created by me to experiment and get the hang of some deep learning neuronal networks.
It may not be completely functional since it is only for testing purposes and a learning experience.

Implementations of UNet and SegNet in Keras and Tensorflow.
UNet inpired from code and tips from [Keras](https://keras.io/) itself.

SegNet inpired from this repo with my changes: [https://github.com/ykamikawa/tf-keras-SegNet](https://github.com/ykamikawa/tf-keras-SegNet)
